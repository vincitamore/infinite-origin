# **A Geometric System with Infinity at the Origin: A Hyperreal Framework for Scale and Dynamics**

## **Abstract**
This article introduces a geometric framework where infinity is positioned at the origin, an infinitesimal scale forms the boundary, and zero is excluded. Constructed using hyperreal numbers, this system redefines the traditional plane and extends to configuration spaces for multi-point systems with generalized properties. It incorporates scale-shape decomposition, adaptable time transformations, and compatibility with curved spaces to integrate individual points, configurations, and dynamics seamlessly. A quantum adaptation enhances the framework by including quantum states, operators, and time transformations, optimizing it for quantum computing algorithms. Key features—such as spatial compactification, metric inversion, and asymptotic duality—support applications in asymptotic analysis, numerical computation, differential equations, multi-body dynamics, gravitational systems, numerical simulation, economic modeling, and quantum computing. This adaptable system equips mathematicians and scientists to investigate phenomena across vast, minute, and quantum scales with precision and clarity.

## **Introduction**
The Cartesian plane, with zero at its center and infinity at its boundaries, has been a fundamental tool in mathematics. However, it struggles at extremes: infinities complicate limits, singularities disrupt behavior near zero, and unbounded domains challenge computation. This geometric system reverses that structure by placing infinity at the origin and excluding zero beyond an infinitesimal boundary. Built on the τ-plane using hyperreal numbers, it manages the infinite and encapsulates everything within an infinitesimal edge.

For multi-point systems, the framework separates scale and shape via logarithmic mappings and dynamic time adjustments, distinguishing overall size from relative configuration. Grounded in a robust axiomatic base, it surpasses conventional geometry, offering both theoretical richness and practical value. A quantum adaptation further expands its scope, integrating quantum states and operators to enhance its utility in quantum computing. From analyzing asymptotic function behavior to studying celestial mechanics, economic dynamics, and quantum algorithms, this system provides a powerful perspective to explore phenomena across scales, addressing a timeless pursuit: *to measure the immeasurable.*

## **Axiomatic Foundation**
The system rests on the hyperreal numbers \( *\mathbb{R} \), encompassing finite reals, infinitesimals (positive numbers smaller than any real), and infinite numbers (larger than any real). This foundation ensures accurate handling of extreme scales. The axioms are divided into three main categories—the τ-plane for individual points, configuration spaces for multiple points with generalized properties, and dynamics—along with a quantum adaptation for quantum computing applications.

### **Axioms for the τ-Plane (Individual Points)**
1. **The τ-Plane**  
   The τ-plane is defined as \( (*\mathbb{R})^d \), the space of d-tuples \( \boldsymbol{\tau} = (\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_d) \) where each \( \tau_i \in *\mathbb{R} \), extending the framework to \( d \) dimensions. It uses the Euclidean metric \( d_\tau = \sqrt{\tau_1^2 + \dots + \tau_d^2} \).

2. **Mapping to the r-Plane**  
   For \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \) where \( \tau_i \neq 0 \) for all \( i \), the r-plane position is \( \mathbf{r} = \left( \frac{1}{\tau_1}, \frac{1}{\tau_2}, \dots, \frac{1}{\tau_d} \right) \), defined over \( (*\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\})^d \). The r-plane also uses the Euclidean metric \( d_r = \sqrt{r_1^2 + \dots + r_d^2} \).

3. **Origin as Infinity**  
   The origin \( \boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{0} \) corresponds to an infinite scale in the r-plane. Infinitesimal \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \) maps to infinite \( \mathbf{r} \), preserving the signs of components.

4. **Infinitesimal Boundary**  
   Points where \( |\boldsymbol{\tau}| = \sqrt{\tau_1^2 + \dots + \tau_d^2} \) is infinite correspond to infinitesimal \( \mathbf{r} \), marking the system’s smallest scales.

5. **Scale Spheres**  
   For a hyperreal \( \rho > 0 \), the sphere \( |\boldsymbol{\tau}| = \rho \) implies \( |\mathbf{r}| \approx \frac{1}{\rho} \). An infinitesimal \( \rho \) results in infinite \( |\mathbf{r}| \), while an infinite \( \rho \) yields infinitesimal \( |\mathbf{r}| \).

6. **Scaling Identity**  
   For an infinitesimal \( \delta > 0 \) and an infinite \( H = \frac{1}{\delta} \), the relation \( H \cdot \delta = 1 \) connects reciprocal scales.

7. **Directional Continuity**  
   As \( \tau_i \) transitions through infinitesimals around zero, \( r_i = \frac{1}{\tau_i} \) shifts from positive to negative infinity, maintaining directional consistency.

8. **Extension to Curved Spaces**  
   For curved r-spaces represented as Riemannian manifolds \( (N, g_r) \), the τ-plane can be generalized via a diffeomorphism \( \phi: M \to N \), where \( M \) is a manifold with metric \( g_\tau \). Here, \( \phi \) maps a designated point \( p_0 \in M \) to infinity in \( N \), and points distant from \( p_0 \) to small scales in \( N \). For simplicity, the flat τ-plane often serves as a local approximation.

### **Axioms for Configuration Spaces (Multiple Points)**
9. **Configuration Space for Multiple Points**  
   For \( n \) points, each point \( i \) has a weight \( w_i > 0 \) and a property vector \( \mathbf{p}_i = (p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \dots, p_{ik}) \), where \( w_i \) weights positional contributions, and \( \mathbf{p}_i \) denotes system-specific attributes (e.g., mass, charge, capital). Positions are \( \mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_n \in \mathbb{R}^d \), possibly with constraints like \( \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{0} \). Weights and properties are selected based on the system, such as \( w_i = ||\mathbf{p}_i|| \) or through optimization.

10. **Scale Factor**  
    The scale factor is defined as \( s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i |\mathbf{r}_i|^2}{W}} \), where \( W = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \), quantifying the configuration’s overall size.

11. **Flexible Scale Coordinate**  
    Define \( \sigma = \log s \), with \( \sigma \in (-\infty, \infty) \), mapping \( s \to \infty \) to \( \sigma \to \infty \) and \( s \to 0 \) to \( \sigma \to -\infty \).

12. **Shape and Orientation Coordinates**  
    Shape coordinates \( \theta \) (scale-invariant) describe relative positions, while orientation coordinates \( \phi \) (in the rotation group) manage rotation—e.g., in 2D, \( \theta \) covers a shape sphere, and \( \phi \) is an angle.

13. **Full Parameterization**  
    The configuration space is parameterized as \( (\sigma, \phi, \theta) \), with \( \sigma \) on the real line, \( \phi \) in the rotation group, and \( \theta \) in the shape space.

14. **Configuration Extremes**  
    As \( \sigma \to \infty \), the system expands infinitely; as \( \sigma \to -\infty \), it collapses, with \( \theta \) preserving shape.

15. **Interaction with τ-Mappings**  
    Each \( \mathbf{r}_i \) maps to \(
